## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn and improve my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but mainly to learn TailWind.
The reason why I learned Tailwind is because when I was developing projects where the goal was more Backend or not so focused on design, I wasted a lot of time designing the website so that it could be minimally nice and usable, doing it with vanilla CSS is for me an excessive waste of energy, Tailwind makes everything a lot easier.
I really enjoyed learning Tailwind and had a lot of fun making this website.
<br>

> I chose to make this website with the Save a Fox theme because I love foxes and also because I wanted to make a sort of "upgrade" to the website of my favorite organization that helps and protects foxes.
I hope they will see this website :)

## UI Design

Here I show my Figma project where I designed this project before going to the development phase, I learned that defining a design before developing is important for the development process to be efficient. 

The design that you see in Figma is different from the final result because changes were made in the final design.

## What i have learned

In this project besides learning HTML, CSS and JS, what I have learned the most in this project is Linux, yep Linux, you will say "Linux? but what does Linux have to do here?" Well I tell you, when I was learning Tailwind developing this project I found serious problems that originated in Windows, it is possible that some of the failures are not because of Windows, but anyway.

The problems that Windows gave me and the stress it made me go through was horrible, I could advance a little more using a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) but even so I could not work, it bothered me a lot, my last option was to try Linux and wait for the problems to be solved, after many years without using it, I proceeded to install Arch Linux and after two damned weeks struggling with Linux to make a nice and functional desktop environment for development I could return to the project without any problem and in a very comfortable way.

That struggle with Linux made me learn a lot about the operating system and how it is built, that knowledge is important for a programmer.
It was fun :)
